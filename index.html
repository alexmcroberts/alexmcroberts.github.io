            <p>This is the third post in the series digging in to Apple's future with AR. A follow up since the announcement of Apple's Vision Pro headset</p>
            <p>This post is intended to be a recap to see how close I got to guessing what Apple were going to ship as part of the Vision Pro device.</p>

            <p>This is the second post in the series digging in to Apple's future with AR. <a href="index.html">Check out Part 1: The reality of Apple and AR</a></p>
            <p>Since they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211011041410/https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf">launched in 1987</a>, Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview">Human Interface Guidelines</a> have long been held as a standard for understanding how to build experiences for people using Apple products.</p>
            <p>I'll cover how the Human Interface Guidelines might be revealing a lot more about the Apple AR headset than we would other guess at.</p>

            <p>Apple's work on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality has been staring us in the face, for quite a while. With the rumour mill working over time on Apple's much anticipated headset, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at what's already in Apple's ecosystem, and how each piece might come together in an Apple designed headset.</p>
            <p>For context, I worked for a startup, <a href="https://smartclothinglab.com/brands/what-happened-to-recon-instruments/">Recon Instruments</a>, in the early-to-mid 2010's working on a form of Augmented Reality – ski glasses, and sunglasses with a built in display. Recon Instruments was then acquired by Intel, where we started working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video">some other interesting projects</a>.</p>
            <p>I'll cover a few components as they exist today in Apple's ecosystem, and how the technology might be transformed, and applied in a Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality headset.</p>
